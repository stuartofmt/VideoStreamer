Debian Bullseye uses a new and different set of drivers on the raspberry pi.

Apparently - these work fine on the rapberry pi 4 but may not work on earlier versions

To get the pi camera to work requires changes to the file /boot/cmdline.txt

This is the relevent section of /boot/cmdline.txt for a raspberry pi 3B+ using the V2 pi camera.
Note the dtoverlay= setting depends on the type of pi camera and taken from the table in this post:

https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html

[all]
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
dtoverlay=imx219
gpu_mem=128

[pi4]
#dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
# Run as fast as firmware / board allows
#arm_boost=1
